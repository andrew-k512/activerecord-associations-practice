Make use of the methods added to your models by the associations in order to answer the following questions.
The Rails guide on associations can remind you what those methods are. Do not use where queries.

1.    Find the album titled "Vinicius De Moraes", and then use an association-provided method to find all its tracks.

    Album.where(title: 'Vinicius De Moraes')
    Track.all.where(album_id: 247)


2.    Find the artist called "Philip Glass Ensemble", and then use an association-provided method to find all their albums.

    Album.where(artist_id: '275')
